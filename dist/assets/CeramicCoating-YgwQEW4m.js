A single-layer coating starts around $800–$1,200, while multi-layer professional coatings with full paint correction range from $1,500–$3,500+. Larger vehicles and exotic cars may cost more. Contact us for a personalized quote."},{question:"How long does ceramic coating last in Miami's climate?",answer:"Professional-grade ceramic coatings installed at Bespoke Auto Design last 2–7+ years depending on the package. Our premium multi-layer coatings are specifically formulated to withstand Miami's intense UV exposure, humidity, and salt air. With proper maintenance, your coating will continue to perform and protect throughout its rated lifespan."},{question:"What is the difference between ceramic coating and wax?",answer:"Traditional wax lasts weeks and offers minimal protection. Ceramic coating is a semi-permanent nano-ceramic layer that chemically bonds to your paint, providing years of protection against UV, chemical etching, water spots, and contaminants. It also delivers a deeper, more intense gloss that wax simply cannot match — especially important under Miami's bright sun."},{question:"Can ceramic coating prevent scratches?",answer:"Ceramic coating adds a hard, sacrificial layer (9H hardness) that resists light marring and wash-induced swirl marks. However, it is not a substitute for paint protection film (PPF) when it comes to rock chips and deep scratches. Many of our Miami clients combine PPF on high-impact areas with ceramic coating on the rest of the vehicle for comprehensive protection."},{question:"Do I still need to wash my car after ceramic coating?",answer:"Yes, but washing becomes dramatically easier. Ceramic coating's hydrophobic properties cause water, dirt, and contaminants to bead and slide off the surface. Most road grime rinses away with just water, and bird droppings or bug splatter wipe off effortlessly. We recommend hand washing every 2–3 weeks to maintain the coating's performance."},{question:"How long does ceramic coating installation take?",answer:"A professional ceramic coating installation takes 2–5 days depending on the package. This includes multi-stage paint correction (removing swirl marks, scratches, and oxidation), surface decontamination, and precise coating application with controlled curing. We never rush the process — your vehicle stays in our climate-controlled facility throughout."},{question:"Is ceramic coating worth it in Miami?",answer:"Absolutely. Miami's combination of extreme UV, salt air, acid rain, and constant sun exposure makes ceramic coating one of the best investments for any vehicle. It prevents UV-induced paint oxidation, protects against chemical etching from bird droppings and tree sap, and keeps your finish looking showroom-fresh with minimal maintenance."},{question:"Can ceramic coating be applied over paint protection film?",answer:"Yes — and we highly recommend it. Applying ceramic coating over PPF enhances the film's hydrophobic properties, makes it easier to clean, and adds an extra layer of UV protection. This combination is the ultimate protection stack and is one of our most popular requests from luxury and exotic car owners in Miami."}],W=()=>{const[p,n]=u.useState(!1);return g.useEffect(()=>{document.title="Ceramic Coating Miami | Professional Paint Protection | Bespoke Auto Design";const a=document.querySelector('meta[name="description"]');a&&a.setAttribute("content","Professional ceramic coating in Miami, FL.
