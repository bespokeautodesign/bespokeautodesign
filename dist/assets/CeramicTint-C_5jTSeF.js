A standard sedan typically costs $350–$600, SUVs $450–$750, and full windshield tinting adds $200–$350. Exotic and luxury vehicles may vary. Contact us for an exact quote based on your vehicle."},{question:"Is XPEL XR Plus really recommended by the Skin Cancer Foundation?",answer:"Yes. XPEL XR Plus is officially recommended by The Skin Cancer Foundation as an effective UV protectant. The film blocks over 99% of harmful UVA and UVB rays — the same rays responsible for skin cancer, premature aging, and sun damage. This recommendation is based on independent testing confirming XR Plus meets the Foundation's rigorous criteria for UV protection."},{question:"What is the difference between ceramic tint and regular tint?",answer:"Traditional dyed or metallic tints primarily darken windows but offer limited heat rejection and can interfere with electronics. XPEL XR Plus uses multi-layer nano-ceramic particle technology that rejects up to 98% of infrared heat without metallic components — meaning zero interference with GPS, Bluetooth, cell signals, or toll transponders, while providing far superior heat and UV rejection."},{question:"Will ceramic tint set off my car's electronic systems?",answer:"No. Unlike metallic tints, XPEL XR Plus is 100% metal-free. It will not interfere with your vehicle's GPS, cell phone reception, Bluetooth connectivity, satellite radio, key fob signals, or toll transponders like SunPass and E-PASS. This is especially important for modern luxury vehicles with advanced electronic systems."},{question:"How long does ceramic tint last in Miami?",answer:"XPEL XR Plus ceramic tint is engineered for extreme longevity. It will not fade, turn purple, bubble, or peel — even under Miami's intense year-round sun exposure. The film comes with XPEL's manufacturer warranty and is designed to last the lifetime of your vehicle with proper care."},{question:"Is ceramic tint legal in Florida?",answer:"Florida law allows window tint on the rear and back side windows with no darkness limit. Front side windows must allow at least 28% visible light transmission (VLT), and the windshield can only have a non-reflective tint strip along the top AS-1 line. We help you choose the right shade that maximizes heat rejection while staying within Florida's legal requirements."},{question:"How long does ceramic tint installation take?",answer:"Most vehicles are completed in 2–4 hours depending on the number of windows and complexity. We recommend leaving your windows up for 3–5 days after installation to allow the adhesive to fully cure. During this time, small water bubbles may be visible — this is normal and they will disappear as the film dries."},{question:"Can ceramic tint be applied to the windshield?",answer:"Absolutely. We offer XPEL XR Plus windshield tint in lighter shades (typically 70% VLT) that are virtually invisible but still block over 99% of UV rays and reject significant infrared heat. Windshield tint is one of the most impactful upgrades for comfort in Miami — it dramatically reduces dashboard heat, glare, and UV exposure for the driver."}],q=()=>{const[u,r]=p.useState(!1);return f.useEffect(()=>{document.title="Ceramic Window Tint Miami | XPEL XR Plus Installation | Bespoke Auto Design";const t=document.querySelector('meta[name="description"]');t&&t.setAttribute("content","Professional XPEL XR Plus ceramic window tint in Miami, FL.
